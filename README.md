CodeBug v0.1

This is my first attempt at creating a "blog" website revolving around code!

So far, I've learned about useState(), components, routing, and much more! 

I am still learning. Hopefully, as I learn more concepts, I am able to iterate over this and refine it until it can be a fully fledged blogging website.
(maybe not in this repo, but hopefully somewhere!)

Near future goals:
- Allow users to create accounts/sign in
- Learn about how to create a 'CMS' like WordPress, where I (or a user) can create a blog post after signing in so I do not have to create a new page for each blog post
- Learn more about useState();
