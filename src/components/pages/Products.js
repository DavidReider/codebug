import React from 'react'
import '../../App.css'

export default function Products() {
    return(
        <>
            <h1 className="products">Products</h1>
            <p>Ideally, this would be the blog post you clicked on, but I am still practicing React! Instead, this is just the 'services' page. </p>
            <p>
                If you have and resources for me on how I can integrate many blog posts without having to create a new page for each one, that would be great. 
                Maybe even a resource that I would let me add blog posts in the browser? Similar to wordpress, but without needing to have a full CMS?

                If you have that, could you please reach out to me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/Reider_DJ" target="_blank">@Reider_DJ</a>? I would greatly appreciate it.
            </p>
